# Surfs_Up

## Overview of the analysis
After reviewing our weather data app analysis, W.Avy wants more information about the temperature trends before opening up the surf shop. He wants the specific data for the temperatures in June and December in Oahu. Only to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results
June:

- December's temperatures are much lower than June's temperature. Temperature tends to drop slightly but not too much.

- Compared to June's temperatures, December's count of month's lessens and the lowest is at 56 but its highest can go to 83.

## Summary
Statistically, the numbers can be wrong sometimes. Due to the changes in weather and global warming, June's temperature could easily drop as low as December's temperature or the other way around. Using this method to track future temperatures won't be enough to gather the correct weather data for June and December. The belief in using this system should go as far as tracking one to two years max and after continue after two years is over. Information would be more reliable to that point.
